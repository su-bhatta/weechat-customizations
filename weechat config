A full line for separator between prefix (usually nick) and messages:

/set weechat.look.prefix_suffix "│"
Full line for read marker:

/set weechat.look.read_marker_string "─"

Arrows for join/quit (be careful, impact on log files):

/set weechat.look.prefix_join "▬▬▶"
/set weechat.look.prefix_quit "◀▬▬"

/set weechat.color.nicklist_away 244

Scripts to improve functionality:Use the weechat nick colors in the chat area and command line.

/script install colorize_nicks.py
/set weechat.color.chat_nick_colors 1,2,3,4,5,6

Hide joins and parts don’t count as ‘activity’ on a channel.

/set weechat.look.buffer_notify_default message

Hide joins/parts from users that haven’t spoken recently (default is 5 minutes). 

/set irc.look.smart_filter on
/filter add irc_smart * irc_smart_filter *

When joining a channel, a lot of information is spit out, most of which is redundant. Hide all this with the following command.

/filter add irc_join_names * irc_366,irc_332,irc_333,irc_329,irc_324 *

Some visual bits to make Weechat a bit nicer.

/set weechat.look.prefix_same_nick "⤷"
/set weechat.look.prefix_suffix "|"
/set weechat.look.separator_horizontal "—"
set weechat.look.buffer_time_format "${253}%H${245}%M"

This makes alt+n toggle the nicklist.

/key bind meta-n /bar toggle nicklist

/save
