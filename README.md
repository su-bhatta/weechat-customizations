standard addons to weechat

I recently moved from irssi to weechat
Things are interesting here in weechat and following some guides set up my weechat.
Official weechat Quick Start Guide : https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_quickstart.en.html#join_part_irc_channels
that is a good place to start , but there are 3 more webpages from the rest of the configuration and addons are taken .

All details are listed in the file.
